# psmodulecache

This action makes caching PowerShell modules from the PowerShell Gallery easy for Linux, Windows and macOS runners. Basically, it builds all of the required input for [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache).

If you're using GitHub Actions to test projects that rely on PowerShell modules like PSFramework or dbatools, this caches those modules so they aren't downloaded from the PowerShell Gallery over and over again.

> **Warning**
> GitHub will [deprecate](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/) all versions of this Action earlier than v5.1 on June 1, 2023. It is recommended that you update all of your workflows now to use psmodulecache@v5.1 or greater.

## Documentation

Just copy the code below and modify the line **`modules-to-cache: PSFramework, PoshRSJob, dbatools`** with the modules you need.

```yaml
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: PSFramework, PoshRSJob, dbatools
```

If you need to use `RequiredVersion`, add a colon then the version: **`modules-to-cache: PSFramework, dbatools:1.1.0`**

```yaml
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: PSFramework, dbatools:1.1.0
```

For a cache with an update search each time your Action is executed, add two

: **`modules-to-cache: PSFramework, Pester::, dbatools::1.1.0`**

In this case set the updatable parameter to true.

```yaml
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: PSFramework,Pester::, dbatools:1.1.0
        updatable: true
```

If you need to install a prerelease, use the `modules-to-cache-prerelease` parameter : **`modules-to-cache-prerelease: PnP.PowerShell:1.11.44-nightly`**

```yaml
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: PSFramework,Pester:4.10.1, dbatools:1.1.0
        modules-to-cache-prerelease: PnP.PowerShell:1.11.44-nightly
```

Note:
Under Windows Powershell if the module targets both versions of PS, then PSCore uses the path of Powershell v5.1.

It is therefore not necessary to create an installation (a Step) for each version of Powershell.

On the other hand under Windows with PS Core the same module targeting two versions will be only installed in the specific directory of PS Core.
## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. [Example workflows](#example-workflows) are available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

* `modules-to-cache` - A comma-separated list of PowerShell module names to install and then cache. Each module name can specify a version or auto-update
* `modules-to-cache-prerelease` -A comma-separated list of PowerShell module names marked as a prerelease, to install and then cache. Each module name can specify a version or auto-update.
* `shell` - The default shell you'll be using. Defaults to pwsh. Recognized shells are 'powershell' and 'pwsh', you can specify one or the other, or both.
* `updatable` - Triggers, on each execution of the action, an update for the module names that request it. Defaults to false.
* `prefixidentifier` - Prefixes the cache key name with the Workflow name ($env:GITHUB_WORKFLOW). Used to group cache keys. Defaults to false.

### Prerelease module versions

The following text details the rule for building a prerelease version number.
[Prerelease module versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/concepts/module-prerelease-support?view=powershell-5.1)

### Cache scopes

The cache is scoped to the key and branch. The default branch cache is available to other branches.

### Search in repositories

The modules indicated in the `modules-to-cache' or 'modules-to-cache-prerelease' parameter can come from PsRepositories declared in the Runner (server).

To declare PsRepositories again, you must save them before calling the 'Cache' step.

The search order is made according to the list returned by Get-PSRepository, in the event of multiple presence of the same module, its most recent version is retrieved.

### Syntax for 'modules-to-cache' parameter

#### InvokeBuild

Simple module name, we save the last stable version found. For this syntax, we do not specify a version number.

The cache content for this module is not updated until the cache lifetime has expired. An Updatable cache will force its update.

#### InvokeBuild:5.0.0

A simple module name followed by a single colon and a three-part version number (mandatory), the requested stable version is recorded.

The cache content for this module will always be the same, regardless of the cache lifetime.

#### PnP.PowerShell::

Simple module name followed by two colons. For this syntax, we do not specify a version number. The last stable version found is saved.

An update search is started each time your Action is executed.

The cache content is updated as soon as a new version is released or the cache lifetime has expired.

### Syntax for 'modules-to-cache-prerelease' parameter

The syntax is the same as for the 'module-to-cache' parameter but concerns only prerelease versions.

#### InvokeBuild

Simple module name, we save the last prerelease version found. For this syntax, we do not specify a version number.

The cache content for this module is not updated until the cache lifetime has expired. An Updatable cache will force its update.

#### PnP.PowerShell:1.11.22-nightly

A simple module name followed by a single colon and a four-part version number (mandatory), the requested prerelease is saved.

The cache content for this module will always be the same, regardless of the cache lifetime.

#### PnP.PowerShell::

Simple module name followed by two colons. For this syntax, we do not specify a version number. The last prerelease found is saved or the latest stable version if there is no prerelease.

An update search is started each time your Action is executed.

The cache content is updated as soon as a new prerelease  is released or the cache lifetime has expired.

#### Duplicate module name

Duplicate module name are allowed.

We may want to install a stable version and the last prerelease :

```
modules-to-cache: PnP.PowerShell:1.11.0
modules-to-cache-prerelease: PnP.PowerShell
```

Or a previous version and the latest version :

`modules-to-cache: PnP.PowerShell:1.10.0,PnP.PowerShell`

You can also force the update for prereleases :

```
modules-to-cache: PnP.PowerShell:1.11.0
modules-to-cache-prerelease: PnP.PowerShell::
```

All other syntax duplications will run installs of the affected module names multiple times.

Note : YAML may need to use double quotation marks: **`modules-to-cache: "Pester::"`**

#### Error message

GitHub Action stop a step as soon as [an error is triggered](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#exit-codes-and-error-action-preference).

> The creation of a cache is effective if there was no error during the execution of the workflow.

We analyze all the module information before stopping the processing.

Syntax errors or incorrect parameter values will be displayed as a warning followed by an exception.

##### Notes

- The following setting:

   `@{Modules=UnknownModule; Shells=powershell,pwsh}`

Generates two identical errors, one for each shell.

- Duplicate shell names are silently removed and therefore do not generate an error:

   `@{PrereleaseModules='PSScriptAnalyzer'; Shells='powershell,pwsh,pwsh,Powershell'}`

- The following error is thrown:

> Find-Package: No match was found for the specified search criteria and the updatable module name 'MyModule' (repositories 'PSGallery').

When

* the module name does not exist in the configured repositories,
* the requested version does not exist in the configured repositories,
* the URI of one of the configured repositories is wrong.

### Using pwsh on Ubuntu.

For these modules, the cache will contain the current versions when the cache is created.

The contents of the cache will be identical as long as its retention period is not exceeded. It may be different during its next creation.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-on-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      id: psmodulecache
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: PSFramework, PoshRSJob
    - name: Show that the Action works
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
          Get-Module -Name PSFramework, PoshRSJob -ListAvailable | Select Path
```

Using `powershell` on Windows. `pwsh` also works and is the default.

For these modules, the cache will contain the current versions when the cache is created.

The contents of the cache will be identical as long as its retention period is not exceeded. It may be different during its next creation.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-on-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      id: psmodulecache
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: PSFramework, PoshRSJob
    - name: Show that the Action works
      shell: powershell
      run: |
          Get-Module -Name PSFramework, PoshRSJob -ListAvailable | Select Path
          Import-Module PSFramework
```

Install for both `powershell` and `pwsh` on Windows. For these modules, the cache will contain the current versions when the cache is created.

The contents of the cache will be identical as long as its retention period is not exceeded. It may be different during its next creation.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-for-both-pwsh-and-powershell:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0
      - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
        id: psmodulecache
        uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
        with:
          modules-to-cache: PoshRSJob, dbatools
          shell: powershell, pwsh
      - name: Show that the Action works on pwsh
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Get-Module -Name PoshRSJob -ListAvailable | Select Path
          Import-Module PoshRSJob
      - name: Show that the Action works on PowerShell
        shell: powershell
        run: |
          Get-Module -Name PoshRSJob, dbatools -ListAvailable | Select Path
          Import-Module PoshRSJob
```

Install a module with a required version, using powershell on Windows. For this module, the cache will always contain this version.

The cache content will be identical regardless of creation cycles due to retention period exceeded.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-for-powershell-on-windows-with-required-v ersion:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0
      - name: Install a module with a required version
        id: psmodulecache
        uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
        with:
          modules-to-cache: dbatools:1.0.0
          shell: powershell
      - name: Show that the Action works on PowerShell
        shell: powershell
        run: |
          Get-Module -Name dbatools -ListAvailable | Select Path
          Import-Module dbatools
```

Install a module with an automatic version update, using pswh on MacOS.

For this module, each time the workflow is executed, updates will be checked. The cache will always contain the latest version.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-for-pwsh-on-macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0
      - name: Install a module with a required version
        id: psmodulecache
        uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
        with:
          modules-to-cache: "dbatools::"
          shell: pwsh
          updatable: "true"
      - name: Show that the Action works on Pwsh
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Get-Module -Name dbatools -ListAvailable | Select Path
          Import-Module dbatools
```

#### Using PowerShell on Windows.

In this example, the version of the `Pester` module is fixed, we always use the latest version for the `dbatools` module and the version of the `PSScriptAnalyzer` module does not matter, we use the one available when creating the cache.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-on-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2.5.0
    - name: Install and cache PowerShell modules
      id: psmodulecache
      uses: potatoqualitee/psmodulecache@v5.2
      with:
        modules-to-cache: dbatools::,Pester:5.3.3, PSScriptAnalyzer
        shell: powershell
        updatable: "true"
    - name: Show that the Action works
      shell: powershell
      run: |
          Get-Module -Name PSFramework, PoshRSJob -ListAvailable | Select Path
          Import-Module PSFramework
```

## Cache key construction method

The key name of a cache is constructed as follows:

* The name of the runner OS: $env:RUNNER_OS,
* the version number of the PSModuleCache action,
* the cache type: Immutable or Updatable,
* the names of the specified shells,
* followed by module names, and version number if requested. If given, the content of the 'module-to-cache' parameter is parsed first.

Each part is separated by a hyphen character '-'.

When the `prefixidentifier` parameter is present we add at the beginning key name the name of the current Workflow ($env:GITHUB_WORKFLOW).

Note: The presence of the hyphen character in a module name does not create any problems in this context.

## Cache Limits

A repository can have up to 5GB of caches. Once the 5GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on when the cache was last accessed.  Caches that are not accessed within the last week (7 days) will also be evicted.
